-------- Learning 
1. AI tools can navigate and describe everything very vauge way , we need to provide very specific prompts and refine them to get the best possible output .
2. AI tools can provide best possible solutions for a problem , but we need to validate and test them to get the best possible output as most of the changes related to SSR and API routes  are not completely done by AI tools ,even when it responds done.
3. AI tools may provide either SSR or Client side code too much depending on the tool, we need to ask specifically what we want and how do we want it to be done .
4. AI tools can work in  a specific environment, we should be very careful to mix two different features in one chat ,it may have issues with context and may not provide the best possible output .
5. Every tool that i used worked till a point and started throwing random solutions after a point , its best that we remain in limits and not overdo prompts.
